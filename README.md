# MicroGrad
Mini Neural Network Project

🤖 Neural Network Engine

A simple yet powerful Neural Network Engine implemented in Python from scratch. This project provides a basic framework for automatic differentiation and building neural networks using custom classes.

🚀 Features

🔢 Custom Autograd Engine for backpropagation.

🔗 Value Class for tracking operations and gradients.

🧠 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) implementation.

⚡ ReLU Activation for non-linearity.

🏗️ Modular Design with Neurons, Layers, and Models.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python for the core implementation.

NumPy for numerical operations.

Matplotlib (planned) for visualization.
